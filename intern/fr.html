              <br><p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>A. Identifying Areas of Interest</p>
              <p>• Most of you are beginning your third year now and would have a decent idea on what
                you are interested in. If not, identify a field in which you’d want to do your internship in.</p>
              <p>• Look at the projects you’ve done and courses you’ve undertaken as well as your
                personal favourite topics for choosing an area of interest.</p>
              <p>• If you’ve done a previous internship, judge yourself as to whether that’s a field you like
                and would like to go ahead with.</p>
               <p>• It’s not important that you have to apply for an internship in fields where you did well in
                your course or an area where you’ve done a project already but it is better to apply in
                fields you have worked in as your application stands a better chance to be accepted.</p><br>
                <p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>B. Getting your Resume ready</p>
                <p>• Your resume is the most important document for you over your college period. You sell
                  yourself to a company or a university professor with it and hence, you must spend
                  ample time on making your resume look good. (This does not mean you fill it up with
                  nonsense!)</p>
                <p>• Get your resume ready at the earliest because you need to send it along with your
                  application cover mail.</p>
                <p>• There isn’t any specific template that makes your resume good-looking. Choose a
                  template of your choice. You can see a lot of example resumes online. A document
                  containing a plethora of sample resumes will be shared with you guys.</p>
                <p>• DO NOT Lie in your resume. Trust me, that is the last thing you want to do.</p><br>
              <p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>C. Creating a Database of Contacts</p>
                <p>• This is the next important step after your resume is ready. Finding relevant professors
                  is not very difficult but it is a time-consuming task. Easily one can take a good 10-30
                  hours finding contacts (if you want a decent database).</p>
                <p>• Go through QS Rankings for having an idea about the Top Universities. Again, have
                  an idea about your resume and your skills before applying to the extreme top
                  universities as these mostly need a stellar resume.</p>
                <p>• Create a spreadsheet with the Headings: Professor Name, University, Email ID, Area
                  of research, Link and Status.</p>
                <p>• After having an idea about universities to apply, go through their web pages and
                  relevant departments. You will get the professor contact there. Some of these pages are
                  difficult to navigate due to poor/ complicated UI.</p>
                <p>• You can also Google with the university and its relevant department name to go
                  straight to that webpage.</p>
                <p>• A point to note is to collect Professor contacts rather than PostDoc and Research
                  Scholars.</p>
                <p>• Collect as many contacts as possible because getting replies is very difficult. There
                  are people who have sent 100 mails and have not got any response.</p><br>
                <p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>D. Writing a good Cover Letter</p>
                  <p>• Cover Letter is what you’ll be sending as an e-mail to the respective professors. A
                    good cover letter is very important as that’s what makes your mail stand out from the
                    100 such internship requests that a professor gets every day.</p>
                  <p>• The Cover Letter should be short and concise with good formatting. It should also be
                    grammatically sound.</p>
                  <p>• A good cover letter format would be the following.<br>
                    I. First Paragraph - Introduction and purpose of writing<br>
                    II. Second Paragraph - Your skills and interests<br>
                    III. Third Paragraph - How are your skills relevant to the position you are applying for<br>
                    IV. Fourth Paragraph - Humble request to accept and greetings</p>
                  <p>• The above given format is not hard and fixed. You may use a format of your choice.
                    The paragraphs may also be split into smaller ones. Make sure that what you write is
                    genuine, polite and to the point.</p>
                  <p>• Reading through the professor’s Research work as well as including details about it in
                    the mail is very important as it shows your interest. For e.g. You may write as if you are
                    interested in a particular project and would like to work together with the professor or
                    you could give your ideas on how to extend the prof’s work.</p>
                  <p>• Have a common cover letter ready so that you easily access it and change just the
                    relevant points according to the Professor and University.</p><br>
                    <p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>E. Mailing the Professor</p>
                    <p>• Once your database and cover letter are ready, you can start mailing!</p>
                    <p>• The best times to mail are from Monday to Thursday (between 10am and 12pm Local
                      Time). Schedule your mail accordingly. Check for any national holidays in that country
                      and try to avoid mailing on those days</p>
                    <p>• As and when you mail, update the Status in your spreadsheet</p>
                    <p>• There are mixed opinions about using personal ID or IIT Id or emailing but I had
                      success with IIT mail and had no issues. So, I’d say, that’s your choice. Also, IIT Id
                      might make the receiver read the email.</p>
                    <p>• Use tools like Mailtrack for tracking your email. Also, if you give a link to your resume
                      using bitly in your email, you can get to know if it has been opened or not.</p>
                    <p>• Do not SPAM a professor with multiple emails. You may send a followup email after
                      3-4 days and even after that if there’s no response just leave it be. Our institute has
                      been blacklisted in the past for mass mailing.</p>
                <p>• It is always advisable not to mention about funding in your first email. Also, if you are
                  applying for a scholarship program, mention in your email that you are applying via it for
                  an internship under the professor.</p>
                <p>• If you don’t get a response, don’t get disappointed. There are people who have sent
                  100 emails and not got a single response. So, all you can do is be patient and put in the
                  effort.</p><br>
                <p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>F. Timeframe</p>
                <p>• Start ASAP on making your resume, cover letter and database. Usually now is the
                  period when everyone sends mails to professors if times were normal. Considering the
                  COVID situation, things might get delayed next year (including Scholarship Programs).
                  As of now, even we are in the blue about things.</p>
                <p>• Start sending mails in this month (August) itself (earlier the better) since there are
                  programs like DAAD-WISE which close by 1 November. Also, usually all the good
                  internships at TOP Universities get filled up soon so better to start mailing early.</p>
                <p>• After you get the response, you need to spend a lot of time on other procedures if you
                  are applying via a scholarship program. These include, writing SOP’s, filling forms,
                  Getting documents ready etc. Easily, one month will be required for all this.</p><br>
                <p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>G. Funding</p>
                <p>• Your expenditure is going to vary according to the region of the University (with places
                  like the US and UK tending to be on the more expensive side and Asian countries
                  slightly cheaper)</p>
                <p>• A rough average of 60,000 INR would be required for expenses per month (main ones
                  being Accommodation, Food and travelling). This is a very vague average and would
                  vary highly depending on the region. You can apply for scholarship programs most of
                  which provide enough money to cover all the expenditure.</p>
                <p>• If you are not applying for Scholarship, you may ask the professor if he/she would
                  provide a stipend but avoid doing so in your first mail. This can be done once you get
                  approval for an internship and establish good communication with the professor.
                  Sometimes a professor might give you some kind of stipend once your work is done if it
                  is satisfactory.</p><br>
                <p style = 'color : rgb(67, 191, 233)'>H. Miscellaneous</p>
                <p>• Get a Passport if you don’t have one already. This takes a good month hence apply for
                  one ASAP.</p>
                <p>• After getting an internship, you will have to apply for a VISA. Take care of the type of
                  VISA required for that country for an internship.</p>
                <p>• Your best sources for help are final year students who have done this before. A list of
                  students who got foreign internships last year has been attached in the Resources
                  Section.</p>

              <p>Dear X<br>
                My name is Rahul R and I am a third-year undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology,
                Bhubaneswar pursuing a four-year Bachelor of Technology course in Mechanical
                Engineering. I will be completing my 6th semester this summer and so far, I have maintained a
                CGPA of 9.07 and am among the top-performing students in my branch.<br>
                I would like to apply for a research internship under your guidance by being a part of your
                Production Technology and Process Automation group during the summer of 2020, under
                the DAAD-WISE program.<br>
                After going through your group’s website, I was really fascinated by the work being done,
                especially with the model-based approach for incremental manufacturing and I’m really
                interested to know how your team goes about it over the two-year course of the project. Getting
                to know about the latest technology and systems being used in the manufacturing and
                production sectors has always been my dream and I hope to learn a lot from this internship.<br>
                In my B. Tech Course, I have taken up core courses on Introduction to Manufacturing
                Processes, Workshop Processes, Introduction to Material Science and Engineering, Theory of
                Machines, Basic Electronics, Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics among other courses. Also, I
                am fluent in Solidworks, Python, C++, Java, and MATLAB.<br>
                I have maintained a good academic record and I have been active in various activities in my
                Institute. My other academic achievements and extracurricular activities are listed in the
                resume.<br>
                I am willing to learn any additional skills required in the months leading up to the internship.
                Hopefully, I can learn a lot from the internship as well as contribute to this field in a significant
                way.<br>
                I thank you very much for taking the time to go through this email, and I hope you'll give me an
                opportunity for research work under you.<br>
                Please find my resume: <a href="http://bit.ly/2KBTtJc"  style = 'color : blue'>http://bit.ly/2KBTtJc</a><br>
                Here is a link to throw more light upon the DAAD-WISE program.<br>

            <p>Dear X<br>
              I am Pruthvi Trinadh Gudivada, a prospective student aspiring to apply for an internship
              position through the IUSSTF-Viterbi Program. I am a third-year undergraduate at the Indian
              Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar (IIT BBS). I will be completing my 6th semester in the
              Summer of 2020 and so far, I have maintained a CGPA of 9.40/10.<br>
              Recently, while browsing through the Summer Research projects of USC Viterbi School of
              Engineering, I came across the projects on neuromorphic hardware that you wish to offer. I
              particularly look forward to collaborating with you, as your work deeply fascinates me and goes
              well in line with my area of research. My primary research interest spans the broad area of
              Computer Architecture and in particular, architecting high-performance and energy-efficient
              brain-inspired hardware for emerging applications. With Deep Learning progressing and new
              and complex algorithms being developed, there is an enormous demand for the chips that can
              perform heavy matrix computations efficiently, and as the CMOS scaling is moving towards an
              end, some of the unconventional technologies(NVMs like STT-RAM, ReRAM etc) and
              bio-inspired Neuromorphic Hardware are coming into the light to these market requirements.
              However, I feel that the major challenge in Neuromorphic research is to match the human
              brain’s flexibility and ability to learn from unstructured stimuli and at the same time achieve
              high-performance and energy efficiency. I am highly interested in designing and implementing
              both software and hardware solutions to address this need.<br>
              I have extensively worked on architecting STT-RAM as an energy-efficient SRAM alternative in
              Caches for hand-held devices, during my sophomore year research internship. I have acquired
              hands-on experience on the Gem5 simulator (system-level simulator) and I have tenaciously
              worked on the Gem-5 simulator for over five months and have developed several models in it as
              per requirement, like the introduction of L0 cache, STT-RAM, Hybrid Memory etc in it. In the
              upcoming winter (Dec 2019), I would be pursuing another internship at the Computational
              Nanoelectronics Laboratory, IIT Gandhinagar, attempting to extensively research on Spiking
              Neural Networks (SNN), investigate it in detail and assimilate maximum possible knowledge
              about it. I have also engaged with FPGAs and Microprocessors and am fluent in C, C++, Python
              and Verilog.<br>
              I find myself inclined towards your areas of interest and I would be extremely elated if you could
              admit me through the IUSSTF-Viterbi program, which I am desirous of pursuing in my upcoming
              summer vacations (for about 2 months i.e. during May 2020 to July 2020) under your esteemed
              guidance and I hope to gain a good amount of knowledge & exposure.<br>
              My academic achievements, certifications and the various projects that I have been working on
              are listed in my CV that I have attached herewith.<br>
              
              I am fully aware of the perseverance and sincerity required for a research internship and I
              strongly believe that my aptitude and motivation will always help me. I thank you to infinity for
              taking time to go through this email and I earnestly request you to apprise me of the opportunity
              for research internship work under you. I am looking forward to working together.<br>

            <p>Dear Dr. X<br>
              My name is Saif Ali Khan and I am a third-year undergraduate at Indian Institute of
              Technology Bhubaneswar, a premier institute for engineering in India, pursuing a four-year
              Bachelor of Technology course in Mechanical Engineering. I will be completing my 6th
              semester this summer and so far, I have maintained a CGPA of 8.91, hence securing a position
              among the top performers of my batch.<br>
              Recently I was browsing through the Institute of Fluid Mechanics of Karlsruhe Institute of
              Technology where I came across your field of study of modelling of evaporation in
              microchannels, and found it fascinating. I am writing to you seeking an opportunity to work with
              you in the aforementioned domain.<br>
              In my B. Tech curriculum, I have undertaken a course on Fluid Mechanics, apart from other core
              courses on Thermodynamics, Mechanics of Solids, Theory of Machines, Heat Transfer and
              Programming and Data Structures. I am well-versed in performing CFD analysis using
              OpenFOAM, also I am fluent in modelling softwares like SolidWorks, ANSYS, AutoCAD and
              programming languages including C, Python, and MATLAB.<br>
              Currently, I am working on a research project in Fluid-Structure Interaction under Dr. Venugopal
              Arumuru using the open-source software OpenFOAM. The project revolves around CFD
              analysis of an elastic flap oscillating about one of its sides, in a flow of liquid. Previously, I have
              worked in the design and development of an experimental set up for the verification of
              Bernoulli’s Equation under Dr. Venugopal Arumuru for the Fluid Dynamics Lab of IIT
              Bhubaneswar using SolidWorks. Besides this I previously held a summer internship at
              Balkrishna Industries Ltd, where I studied various processes involved in tyre manufacturing.<br>
              It would be very grateful of you to accord me an opportunity to assist you in a research project in
              the summer of 2020 (i.e. during 10 May 2020 and 15 July 2020). This opportunity would help
              me in gaining in-depth knowledge & exposure to the field of research. With you giving me this
              opportunity, I will be eligible to apply for a DAAD scholarship which shall bear the expenses
              during the internship period.<br>
              
              I have maintained a good academic record and I have been active in various activities in my
              institute. I have attached my resume and transcript with this email for your reference.<br>
              I thank you for taking out your valuable time to go through this email, and I earnestly request
              you to apprise me of the opportunity for research work under you. Awaiting your response.<br>
              Thank You Warm regards,<br>
              Saif Ali Khan<br>

            <p>Dear Dr. X<br>
              I am a third-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)
              Bhubaneswar, pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering as my major.
              I would like to apply for a research internship under your guidance by being a part of your
              Artificial & Collective Intelligence group during the summer of 2020, under the DAAD-WISE
              program.<br>
              After going through your group's website, I was fascinated by the work being done by your
              group. I also saw your TEDx talk and it was interesting to see how the biological concept of a
              bee swarm was applied to charging electric cars. Extrapolating on that, in traditional
              reinforcement learning approaches, the reward is handcrafted by the individual formulating the
              Markov Decision Process. It would be interesting to see how this reward function can be
              tweaked in such a way that it draws inspiration from a lot of biological organisms that
              collaborate together, such as ants, bees, and pack animals. We could then apply that to a lot of
              multi-agent reinforcement learning problems such as energy transaction amongst microgrids,
              traffic flow optimization, and multiagent cyber-physical systems.<br>
              I have always been interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and
              during the summer of 2019, I was the recipient of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Summer
              Research Fellowship, which enabled me to intern at the Computer Sciences and Automation
              Department at the Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc) Bengaluru, under the guidance of Dr.
              Shalabh Bhatnagar. Our group worked on a project titled ‘A unified reinforcement framework for
              
              demand and supply side management amongst microgrids’. We are currently in the process of
              writing a paper for the same, for the upcoming AAAI Conference.<br>
              Due to a collaboration between IISc and AlphaIC (a startup that focuses on creating edge
              computing devices), I also got an opportunity to work on a project titled ‘Experiments on Low
              Shot Learning’ where our main goal was to test and create deep learning models that generated
              decorrelated embeddings which would, in turn, enhance low shot learning accuracies.<br>
              I would be eager to learn any additional skills that would be required, during the months leading
              up to the internship. Hopefully, by the end of this internship, I would not only have learned a lot
              but also have contributed to this field in a small but significant way.<br>
